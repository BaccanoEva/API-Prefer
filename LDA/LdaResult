Coherence measures the relative distance between words within a topic. There are two major types C_V typically 0 < x < 1 and uMass -14 < x < 14. It's rare to see a coherence of 1 or +.9 unless the words being measured are either identical words or bigrams. Like United and States would likely return a coherence score of ~.94 or hero and hero would return a coherence of 1. The overall coherence score of a topic is the average of the distances between words. I try and attain a .7 in my LDAs if I'm using c_v I think that is a strong topic correlation. I would say:
.3 is bad
.4 is low
.55 is okay
.65 might be as good as it is going to get
.7 is nice
.8 is unlikely and
.9 is probably wrong
